/*
Any number is even if it is completely divisible by 2 (nรท2 then remainder = 0)

Pro:                                    
As numbers are stored in bin 2^n . 10 = 1 0 1 0
                                    1 = 0 0 0 1
                 **********    10 & 1 = 0 0 0 0  = LSB is 0 so num is EVEN.
                                    
                                    5 = 0 1 0 1
                                    1 = 0 0 0 1
                 **********     5 & 1 = 0 0 0 1  = LSB is 1 so num is ODD.
